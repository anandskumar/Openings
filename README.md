# Openings
Dynamic job listings

The list of open positions in various teams / ACs in Vibha are dynamically pulled from a spreadsheet and displayed on a web page.

All the job listing are added in a spreadsheet, one opening per row.

Uses Tabletop.js (https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to read the Google spreasheet

And uses Handlebars (http://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating job descriptions to be listed on the web page.
